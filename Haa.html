            Hello
        </h1>
        <p>
            This is My personal website (which probably wont be getting live anytime soon) where I just do my stuff which I want to do.

    <h2>
        Who am I?
    </h2>
        <p>
            No I am not having an identity crisis or something, I am just a human on earth who is pretty high in height but smol in age. I dont really have many words to put in here but i will soon as i get older and have more things to share with you people (if you are).
        </p>

    <h2>
        Why am I doing this???
    </h2>
        <p>
            I dont know why I am doing this but probably because I am bored and want to fll up my free time which I barely have into doing something like this.
        </p>
    
    <h2>
        What have I done!?
    </h2>
        <p>
            Not much, I have learnt python a little bit and am currrently making a poject on it on github. I will be putting a link over here soon I suppose. I also have a JUNIOR DIPLOMA in classical music. I also had started drawing a little before the lockdown period, I have posted a lot of my drawings on instagram.

    <h2>
        Why is this like this???
    </h2>
        <p>
            Well... it because I dont have a lot of skills in HTML but I am trying to relearn it.

            well currently I am doing some programming in python and stuff and have a repository made in github where I am mostly active and the name of that repo is MoneyMaker... it has some projects that are ongoing like the file "MM0.4.py" is the latest one and well the main problem in every one of these is that i'm not getting a way to loop it.
