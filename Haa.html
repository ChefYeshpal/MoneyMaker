    <h2>
        Who am I?
    </h2>
        <p>
            No I am not having an identity crisis or something, I am just a human on earth who is pretty high in height but smol in age. I dont really have many words to put in here but i will soon as i get older and have more things to share with you people (if you are).
        </p>

    <h2>
        Why am I doing this???
    </h2>
        <p>
            I dont know why I am doing this but probably because I am bored and want to fll up my free time which I barely have into doing something like this.
        </p>
    
    <h2>
        What have I done!?
    </h2>
        <p>
            Not much, I have learnt python a little bit and am currrently making a poject on it on github. I will be putting a link over here soon I suppose. I also have a JUNIOR DIPLOMA in classical music. I also had started drawing a little before the lockdown period, I have posted a lot of my drawings on instagram.
